Privacy Policy for Aviation GPT
Last Updated: July 29, 2025

Aviation GPT (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is a custom AI assistant designed to help student and private pilots with FAA regulations, weather briefings, and aircraft‑specific guidance. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.

1. Information We Collect
1.1. User‑Provided Data
Chat Inputs: All text you enter (questions, commands, station identifiers like “KSTL”).

Account Data: If you register or log in, we collect your username and email address.

1.2. Automatically Collected Data
Usage Logs: Timestamps of your requests, which API endpoints are called (e.g., /metar, /taf), and any error messages.

Technical Data: Your IP address, browser type/version, operating system, and device identifiers.

2. How We Use Your Information
Service Delivery: To fetch and return FAA regulations, weather data (METAR/TAF), and handbook content.

Performance & Reliability: To monitor uptime, diagnose errors, and improve response accuracy.

Analytics: To understand feature usage patterns and prioritize enhancements.

3. Data Sharing
Weather Proxy (Replit): Station codes you request are forwarded to our proxy server on Replit, which then calls AviationWeather.gov. That proxy may log request metadata under Replit’s privacy terms.

AviationWeather.gov: We retrieve raw and decoded METAR/TAF data; AviationWeather.gov may log access in accordance with their policy.

No Additional Sharing: We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal data with any other third parties.

4. Data Retention
Chat Logs & Usage Data: Retained for up to 90 days for debugging and analytics, then purged.

Account Information: Retained until you request deletion or deactivate your account.

Deletion Requests: Email support@aviationgpt.example.com to request complete removal of your data.

5. Security Measures
Encryption: All traffic between you and Aviation GPT, and between our proxy and weather APIs, is protected by HTTPS/TLS.

Access Controls: Internal logs and data stores are protected behind authentication; no hard‑coded secrets are exposed publicly.

Vulnerability Management: We perform regular dependency audits and patch any known security issues promptly.

6. Your Rights
Access & Portability: You may request a copy of your chat transcripts and profile data.

Correction: You may ask us to correct any inaccurate personal information.

Deletion: You may request permanent deletion of your personal data at any time.

Opt‑Out: You can opt out of non‑essential analytics; core functionality will remain available.

To exercise these rights, contact support@aviationgpt.example.com.

7. Children’s Privacy
Aviation GPT is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, please contact us for removal.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you via email (if registered) or by a prominent notice in the service. The “Last Updated” date at the top reflects the current policy version.
